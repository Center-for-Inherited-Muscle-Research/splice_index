# splice_index
Scripts and inputs for the CIMR lab's splice index pipeline

All files at this directory level are to be used for the Splice Index data processing pipeline, which intakes raw, paired fastq files sequenced using an Amplicon library prep of the 22 panel splicing events and generates event counts, PSI scores, and Splice Index Scores for each file pair. There are two sets of normative values can be be referenced in the shell script that launched the nextflow pipeline.

The pub_script directory contains the jupyter notebook (and all data inputs) used to do the bioinformatics analysis featured in the Splice Index publication.
